# Yoda Population Growth Simulation

Hello!

This project is a population growth simulation for Yoda's species. It accounts for the following variables:<br />
-starting population<br />
-infant mortality<br />
-available food resources: frogs and mushrooms<br />
-harvested food resources: frogs and mushrooms<br />
-chances of total obliteration by the Death Star<br />

# Updates
12-21-20: Added intial simulation model with hard-coded values. Next push I intend to include a UI that allows the user to control the values of the variables and visualize the output.

12-24-20: Created a Flask server to host web application,
